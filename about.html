                <h4>Patience and Fortitude for All New Yorkers</h4>
                <p>
                  Since its founding in 1995, The Community Library has
                  unwaveringly served New York City, no matter the
                  circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic brought forth
                  unprecedented challenges for our city and our patrons. But as
                  it has always done, the Library quickly adapted to ensure
                  communities could still access the information and resources
                  they needed. While constantly monitoring the rapidly changing
                  circumstances, the Library increased its core digital
                  services—from e-book access to online learning support for
                  students, remote research services, online programs, and
                  virtual one-on-one job support. And as soon as it could, the
                  Library reopened all available branch locations across the
                  Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island in phases
                  to ensure that New Yorkers could access the services and
                  resources they rely on.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  The Library was founded on the ideals of free and open access
                  to knowledge and opportunity for everyone. The challenges of
                  2020 and 2021 did not deter, but rather reaffirmed NYPL’s
                  central objective to serve New Yorkers through even the most
                  turbulent times—a testament to the enduring legacy of the
                  Library as one of the city’s most essential civic
                  institutions.
